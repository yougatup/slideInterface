Based on this prior work, we enable high-level interaction with freeform sketches by structuralizing strokes. This allows presenters to sketch line-based clusters (e.g., words), graphs (e.g., flow charts), and outlines. Our earlier study [9] presented the conceptual design of SketchPoint as a tool for integrating note-taking and presentation. In the current work, we further the previous work with emphasis on informal presentations in the early stages of idea communication. We refine and present SketchPoint as a tool for sketching informal presentations. This paper presents the details of interaction techniques for creating informal presentations, the algorithms for converting sketched outlines into presentation slides, the structure-based manipulation based on both raw and interpreted views of ink strokes, and the implementation of SketchPoint. One of our main goals is to provide a natural way for presenters to organize their information while designing presentations. Shipman et al [19] conducted a user study to find the traditional ways people organize information. Based on their results and our own investigations, we chose implicit and explicit outlines as the major structure for both presentation organizations and slide contents. The storyboard metaphor has been widely used in design [1, 7, 11] because it provides an intuitive and natural way to specify sequences and maintain the structure of information. We applied the interactive storyboard as a means for maintaining the structure of a presentation and for carrying out slide-level manipulations, such as slide duplication, removal and re-layout. Zoomable User Interfaces (ZUIs) [2] present an efficient way to organize lots of information in a limited space. DENIM [11] successfully employs this metaphor to organize the different representations of a web site design into different zoom levels. SketchPoint also utilizes a ZUI to organize the activity of presentation design into four continuous steps, i.e., four zoom levels, and allows the appropriate interaction at each level. There has been much research in facilitating the activity of giving presentations [15] and in enhancing presentations in conference and classroom settings [4, 20].

A structure patch, such as the one containing the flowchart in Figure 12, is used to support arbitrary graphics. When sketching, the sketches are dynamically and implicitly grouped into horizontal line-based clusters based on the temporal and spatial distance and density information. To achieve low cognitive load, the feedback is given in a lazy style so that the presenter can sketch continuously without being disturbed. These line-based clusters work not only for words but also for any symbols that can fit on lines. SketchPoint does not care about the semantics of the sketches themselves. Instead, SketchPoint parses the logical structure of the sketch, i.e., clusters and their relationships. Although SketchPoint mainly supports informal representations of slides, it also provides an optional feature that allows presenters to replace the original ink by recognized words or linked shapes (see Figures 11, 12).

A presenter can enter a word correction mode to correct both segmentation and recognition errors by holding the pen on the cluster for a short moment. SketchPoint performs incremental word segmentation and recognition. Parsing can be improved based on corrections made by the presenter. The presenter can terminate the correction mode by holding the pen down again. SketchPoint also allows presenters to sketch graphics that do not fit in line-based structures. These are placed in structure patches. SketchPoint allows presenters to specify a rectangular area as a structure patch by holding the pen to trigger a rubber-band action. This avoids the need to segment between line-based clusters and arbitrary graphics, which would compromise the stability of the system and introduce usability problems because of the limitations of current algorithms.

We developed the algorithms for continuous word segmentation and graph parsing in SketchPoint. We intend to expand our graph-parsing algorithm to support more graph semantics. We tested SketchPoint with our colleagues to acquire feedback on the usability of its interaction techniques and functionality. They were tested with several simulated tasks. SketchPoint has also been deployed in various setups in our laboratory. We used Wacom LCD tablets (Wacom PL550 and PL300) attached to a 1.3 GHz Pentium 4 PC. We also tested the system with a Wacom Intuous Tablet (9\u00d712) attached to an 800 MHz Pentium III PC with a 17-inch monitor. This early feedback showed that our participants were interested in using SketchPoint for informal idea communication. They found the automatic transformation from notes to informal slides attractive, and thought that SketchPoint would be helpful for communicating ideas informally in internal settings. We observed that people could easily author an informal presentation. Besides asking us to fix some stability problems, our participants also asked for search functions and requested that SketchPoint import non-ink content (e.g., images, text, and audio). User feedback also showed us that SketchPoint needs a more intuitive method for creating hyperlinks when the target slide is not visible in the same screen as the start of the hyperlink. We will explore visualization techniques other than zooming to improve the efficiency of this type of operation. We can easily extend our current system to also support speech annotations. In the future we plan to add this feature along with the playback of time-synchronized ink and speech annotations. Currently, SketchPoint only supports a limited set of ink structures, such as item-list. We intend to add more structures in the future and to use more explicit and implicit interactions to indicate these structures, e.g., using a pen with different ink colors for different structures.
